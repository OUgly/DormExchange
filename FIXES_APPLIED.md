## Database Setup Required:

Since Docker Desktop isn't available, you'll need to:

1. **Apply Database Migrations:**
   Run these SQL files in your Supabase dashboard (SQL Editor):
   - `supabase/migrations/09_create_listing_images_table.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/10_complete_listing_images_setup.sql`

2. **Create Storage Bucket:**
   In Supabase Dashboard → Storage, create a bucket named `listing-images` with public access.

3. **Test the Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Improvements:

### ImageCarousel Component
- Better placeholder when no images
- Improved navigation buttons with icons
- Image counter display
- Error handling for broken images
- Smooth transitions

### ListingCard Component  
- Interactive image swiping on hover
- Multiple image support

- Professional empty state

### Listing Detail Page

## Next Steps:
1. Start Docker Desktop (or use Supabase cloud)
2. Apply the database migrations
3. Test image uploads and display
4. Create some sample listings to verify functionality

All code changes are ready and should work once the database is properly set up!
